Abruptly Goblins - Game Night Planner üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüé≤

Welcome to the Abruptly Goblins project! This Python-based tool helps organize game nights for a tabletop RPG hosted at the Sorcery Society, your comic and games store. Using Python functions and dictionaries, the project determines the best day for game night and sends out email invites to attendees.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Track Availability: Record the availability of gamers using a dictionary-based system.
	‚Ä¢	Find Optimal Day: Identify the best day for hosting the event based on attendee preferences.
	‚Ä¢	Automated Invitations: Programmatically generate email messages to notify participants of the game night.

Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project on your local machine:

Prerequisites
	1.	Python: Install Python by following these instructions.
	2.	Jupyter Notebooks: Install Jupyter to run the notebook interface. You can find installation instructions here.

Installation
	1.	Clone or download this repository:
 	2.	Unzip the downloaded project if necessary.

Running the Project
	1.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
	2.	Start Jupyter Notebook:
	3.	In your browser, open the file Abruptly Goblins Planner.ipynb.
	4.	Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to complete the project. If you get stuck, refer to the Abruptly Goblins Planner (Solution).ipynb file for guidance.

Project Files
	‚Ä¢	Abruptly Goblins Planner.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook where you can write and execute code.
	‚Ä¢	Abruptly Goblins Planner (Solution).ipynb: A completed version of the project for reference.

How It Works
	1.	Gathering Attendee Data: Input gamer names and their available days into a Python dictionary.
	2.	Finding the Best Day: Use functions to evaluate the dictionary and determine the day with the highest availability.
	3.	Sending Invitations: Generate and display email content for attendees based on their availability.

Skills Demonstrated
	‚Ä¢	Python programming fundamentals
	‚Ä¢	Using dictionaries to organize and process data
	‚Ä¢	Writing and calling custom Python functions
	‚Ä¢	Managing and executing Jupyter Notebooks

Future Enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Add a user interface for input and output.
	‚Ä¢	Implement email sending using a Python library like smtplib.
	‚Ä¢	Include error handling for missing or incorrect data.
